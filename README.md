# Restaurant Inspection Dataset Analysis

**Overview**

This dataset contains information about restaurant inspections conducted by the Los Angeles Health Department for permitted food establishments. The inspections aim to ensure compliance with food safety regulations and promote public health. Restaurants are evaluated on various criteria and assigned grades on an A-C scale based on their performance.

**Purpose**

The primary goal of this project is to explore and preprocess the restaurant inspection data to provide insights into food safety compliance in Los Angeles. The dataset helps to assess factors influencing restaurant inspections and provides a basis for identifying potential risks in food safety.

**Data Features**

The dataset consists of multiple features, including:

Activity_Date: Date when the restaurant was inspected.

Restaurant Type: Type/category of the restaurant.
 
Score: Score assigned based on the compliance with food safety regulations.

Grade: The grade (A, B, or C) assigned to the restaurant based on its inspection results.

**Steps Performed**

**1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

-Initial inspection of the dataset structure.

-Data cleaning by handling missing values.

-Data visualizations to understand the distribution of grades, inspection scores, and other features.

**2. Preprocessing**

-Label encoding for categorical variables like restaurant types.

-Date formatting for inspection dates.

-Normalizing numerical columns such as inspection scores and other metrics to ensure consistency.

**Requirements**

To run this project, the following libraries are needed:

pandas

matplotlib

seaborn

scikit-learn

numpy

**Conclusion**

This preprocessing and exploratory analysis provide an essential foundation for developing deeper insights into restaurant safety standards in Los Angeles, which could help public health officials allocate resources effectively.
